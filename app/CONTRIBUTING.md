Mozaic contribution guide
=========================
* create a Github issue, and write a thorough description
* create a pull request referencing the issue and write a thorough description
* write some tests, include comments
* discuss your changes with one of the core contributors, and get it merged!

Release management
==================
* master is the development mainline, and it doesn't mean it's stable
* we will use git tags to tag stable releases on master for now
* if worse comes to worse, we will have version branches like "the 0.3.x line" which is branched off the commit in master tagged with 0.3.2
